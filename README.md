# PyOurFood
A collection of methods for modelling agri-food and land use, including agriculture for food and non-food uses, food production from laboratory through horticulture to livestock to sea, and alternative land uses. It ingests current relevant datasets, connects them to evaluate metrics, and models the impact of agri-food system interventions on current and future metric values.
