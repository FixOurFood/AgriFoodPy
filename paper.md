# Summary

<!-- What is this package -->
`AgriFoodPy` is an open-source Python package for processing, simulation,
and modeling of agrifood datasets and systems.
By employing `xarray` [@hoyer2017xarray] as the primary data structure, `AgriFoodPy`
provides methods to manipulate tabular data by extending `xarray` functionality
via accessor classes. It acts as an accessibility and interoperability
layer between data sources and external packages, and also bundles with a
library of models for use without any additional requirements. 

A separate repository, `agrifoodpy_data`, is actively maintained in parallel to
provide access to local and global agrifood datasets, including geospatial land
use and classification data [@CEH], food supply [@FAOSTAT], life cycle
assessment [@PN18], and population data [@UN]. The `AgriFoodPy` framework is
region-agnostic and provides facilities to model and simulate processes and
intervention impacts regardless of their geographic origin.

# Features

<!-- Current functionality -->
Version 0.1 provides table manipulation methods to extend the coordinate
dimensions of `xarray` Datasets and DataArrays, extract summary statistics, and
includes charting methods to analyze and display data.
It also includes a library of intervention models for supply and demand
changes, afforestation and agroecology, and land carbon sequestration. These can
be used to predict the effectiveness of systemic interventions through key
metrics of the food system.

<!-- External models and interoperability-->
`AgriFoodPy` provides a framework to build interfaces to external tools and
packages which can be used by the community to extend its functionality and
widen the scope of the simulated systems.
This makes it the first multipurpose tool of its kind, allowing wide analysis
of food systems data by integrating diverse datasets, models and
indicators into a unified framework. This allows researchers to make informed
decisions and identify opportunities for systemic change in all areas of food
systems, ranging from production, consumption, and land use to food security,
nutrition, health, and policy-making.

<!-- Future functionality -->
Future releases will provide access to more models and community-contributed
datasets formatted using `xarray`. Additionally, `AgriFoodPy` will implement a
pipeline manager to perform end-to-end simulations of agrifood systems, which
can be used to speed up the comparison of multiple scenarios and build easily
shareable and reproducible workflows.

<!-- Open source development and maintenance -->
Open-source code and community development will allow a transparent view into
analysis choices and data sources, which can help provide trustworthy
evidence-based support for data-driven policymaking. `AgriFoodPy` is developed and
maintained by a diverse community of domain experts with a focus on software
sustainability and interoperability.

# Statement of need

<!-- Background and main references -->
Providing food for an ever-growing population while reducing the impact of human
activity on the environment has become one of the main global challenges.
Local and intergovernmental independent committees
(https://www.theccc.org.uk/, https://www.ipcc.ch/) have reported the impact
of food production on climate change. The scenarios and projections in their
reports also highlight the need for precise and transparent modeling of
different aspects of the food system to help stakeholders understand the
effects of consumption patterns and farming practices.

<!-- Current needs and requirements -->
Coordinated efforts to achieve a sustainable food system must originate from
effective policy-making based on evidence, careful choice of metrics and
indicators to describe the state of the food system, and accurate estimates of
how these metrics change under different scenarios and decisions/interventions.

<!-- Challenges and problematics -->
Existing datasets and analysis software usually rely on non-standardized data
structures and predominantly closed-source code. This hinders research and
independent scrutiny of food system intervention projections and the impact of 
policy on environmental, socio-economic, and health indicators.
Moreover, this forces researchers to routinely expend significant effort
replicating or re-developing existing code to reduce and analyze data.
Additionally, the opacity of some data sources and analysis choices makes it
difficult to draw conclusions from equivalent comparisons between different
interventions and policy decisions.

<!-- What has been made -->
Few open initiatives exist focused on analysis and modeling of agrifood
and environmental related data, e.g., the Environmental Data Science book
(https://edsbook.org/).
The research community has developed open-source tools that address
some individual aspects of modeling agrifood systems, such as geospatial
imaging [e.g., `GeoPandas`, @geopandas; `Rasterio`, @rasterio], atmospheric
and climate modeling [`Fair`, @fair] in Python, and other open softwares in
other languages, including agriculture and farming [`APSIM`, @APSIM] and life
cycle assessment (`OpenLCA`, www.openlca.org).

<!-- How does this package connect with other packages and projects -->
`AgriFoodPy` provides a consistent standard for agrifood data distribution,
while also allowing external models and packages to coexist and interoperate,
which facilitates a holistic approach to agrifood modeling.

<!-- What projects are or will employ AgriFoodPy  -->
Plans for future use in research and communication include the FixOurFood
agrifood calculator (https://fixourfood.streamlit.app/), an interactive
modeling tool to evaluate the effect of food system transformations in the UK.
There are also plans to publish a paper on global diets their social and
environmental impacts.
