# Summary

<!-- What is the package -->
`AgriFoodPy` is an open-source Python package for dataset manipulation,
interoperability, simulation, and modeling of agrifood systems.

<!-- Some specifics on how it does what it does -->
By employing xarray [@hoyer2017xarray] as the primary data structure, AgriFoodPy
provides access methods to manipulate tabular data by extending xarray
functionality via accessors.

A separate repository, `agrifoodpy_data`, is also maintained in parallel to
provide access to local and global agrifood datasets, including geospatial land
use and classification data [@CEH], food supply [@FAOSTAT], life cycle
assessment [@PN18], and population data [@UN]. The `AgriFoodPy` framework is
region-agnostic and will provide facilities to model and simulate processes and
interventions regardless of their geographic origin.

<!-- Open source development and maintenance -->
Open-source code and community development will allow a transparent view into
analysis choices and data sources, which can help provide trustworthy
evidence-based support for data-driven policymaking. AgriFoodPy is developed and
maintained by a diverse community of domain experts with a focus on software
sustainability and interoperability.


<!-- Current functionality -->
Version 0.1 provides basic table manipulation methods to extend the coordinate
dimensions of xarray Datasets and DataArrays, summary statistics and indicators,
and plotting functions to analyze and display data.
It also includes a library of intervention models across a range of observables
and indicators that connect with pre-existing atmospheric, land use change,
socio-economic, and human health models.

<!-- Future functionality -->
Future releases will provide access to more models and community-contributed
datasets formatted using xarray. Additionally, AgriFoodPy will implement a
pipeline manager to perform end-to-end simulations of agrifood systems, which
can be used to speed up the comparison of multiple scenarios.

# Statement of need

<!-- Background and main references -->
Providing food for an ever-growing population while reducing the impact of human
activity on the environment has become one of the main global
challenges. Local and intergovernmental independent committees
(https://www.theccc.org.uk/, https://www.ipcc.ch/) have reported the importance
of food production on climate change. The scenarios and projections in their
reports also highlight the need for precise and transparent modeling of
different aspects of the food system to help stakeholders understand the
effects of consumption patterns and farming practices.

<!-- Current needs and requirements -->
Coordinated efforts to achieve a sustainable food system must originate from
effective policy-making based on evidence, careful choice of metrics and
indicators to describe the state of the food system, and accurate estimates of
how these metrics change under different scenarios.

<!-- Challenges and problematics -->
Existing datasets and analysis software usually rely on non-standardized data
structures and predominantly closed-source code. This hinders research and
independent scrutiny of food system intervention projections and the impact of 
policy on environmental, socio-economic, and health indicators.
Moreover, this forces researchers to routinely expend significant effort
replicating or re-developing existing code to reduce and analyze data.
Additionally, the opacity of some data sources and analysis choices makes it
difficult to draw conclusions from equivalent comparisons between different
interventions and policy decisions.

<!-- What has been made -->
Few open initiatives exist focused on analysis and modelling of agrifood
and enviromental related data, e.g., The Environmental Data Science book
(https://edsbook.org/).
The research community has developed open-source packages that adress
some individual aspects of modelling agrifood systems, such as geospatial
imaging (e.g., `Geopandas` [@geopandas], `Rasterio` [@rasterio]), atmospheric
and climate modeling (`Fair` [@fair]) in Python, and other open softwares in
other languages, such as agriculture and farming (`APSIM` [@APSIM]) and life
cycle assestment (`OpenLCA`, www.openlca.org).

<!-- How does this package connect with other packages and projects -->
AgriFoodPy will provide a consistent standard for agrifood data distribution,
while also allowing external models and packages to coexist and interoperate,
allowing a holistic approach to agrifood modeling.
